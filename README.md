## Introduction

We chart the dynamics of delayed parenthood and its implications for educational and labor market trajectories for
young adult women and men using a novel longitudinal analysis approach, the parametric g-formula. 

This method allows the estimation of both population-averaged effects (among all women and men) and average
treatment effects (among mothers and fathers). Based on high-quality data from Finnish registers, we find that
later parenthood exacerbates the educational advantage of women in comparison to men and attenuates the
income advantage of men in comparison to women across young adult ages. Gender differences in the consequences of delayed parenthood on labor market trajectories are largely not explained by changes in educational
trajectories
